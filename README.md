# Interactive hiking photo map

I use [AllTrails](https://github.com/alltrails) to plan and loosely track my hikes, but I wanted a way to personalize my own hiking map. I am building out an interactive photo album of hikes around the globe.

I used the [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/modules.html) module and the [Python Imaging Library](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in conjunction with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/index.html) to generate an interactive map of my hikes.

### Next steps:

- build out hike list
- add filters for time, geographic location, trail stats
- add wishlist hikes
- add completed/not completed toggle
